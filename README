INTRODUCTION
============

Russian version of this manual is available at

This is a set of templates for monitoring MySQL servers through SNMP protocol with Cacti. 

It is based on the knowledge and techniques of project designs:

1) MySQL Performance Graphs on Cacti via SNMP

2) Percona MySQL Monitoring Template for Cacti

INSTALLATION
============

1) Download "cacti-mysql" project.
   https://github.com/spions/cacti-mysql/archive/master.zip

2) Log into MySQL on monitoring server and execute the following (changing "secret" as appropriate) 
   to give the script permission to monitor:

   [monitoring-server]# mysql -uroot -p
	CREATE USER 'monitor'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
	GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'monitor'@'localhost';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   Mariadb can create a user with a blank password. It needs to be changed.
	SET PASSWORD FOR 'monitor'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('secret');

3) In order to read all these variables from MySQL we need credentials. 
   Change the login and password /etc/snmpd/mysql-stats.conf to access the MYSQL

        cd /etc/snmp/
	wget https://raw.github.com/spions/cacti-mysql/master/mysql-stats.conf

4) Create cache dir, download mysql-stats and change snmpd.conf.

        cd /etc/snmp/
	mkdir /etc/snmp/mysql_cache
	chmod 777 /etc/snmp/mysql_cache
       
	wget https://raw.github.com/spions/cacti-mysql/master/mysql-stats
        chmod 755 mysql-stats

   This one is simply an extension script for snmpd that grabs (and caches) the data when called. 
   Assuming you put this extension script in /etc/snmp and have a cache directory for my extensions 
   of /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/ (as described in previous articles), you can add the following to your 
   /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file and then restart snmpd:

	extend mysqlqcache /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache _qcache_miss_ratio _qcache_hit_ratio qcache_hits qcache_inserts qcache_total_blocks qcache_free_blocks _qcache_used_blocks query_cache_size qcache_free_memory _qcache_used_memory qcache_queries_in_cache
	extend mysqlbufferpool /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache _innodb_buffer_pool_miss_ratio _innodb_buffer_pool_hit_ratio innodb_buffer_pool_reads innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests innodb_buffer_pool_write_requests
	extend mysqlbufferpoolstat /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data innodb_buffer_pool_pages_free innodb_buffer_pool_pages_dirty innodb_buffer_pool_pages_misc
	extend mysqlinnodbrows /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache innodb_rows_read innodb_rows_deleted innodb_rows_updated innodb_rows_inserted
	extend mysqlkeycache /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache _key_miss_ratio _key_hit_ratio key_reads key_read_requests
	extend mysqlcomm /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache questions com_select com_delete com_insert com_update com_replace com_load com_delete_multi com_insert_select com_update_multi com_replace_select
	extend mysqlsort /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache sort_rows sort_range sort_merge_passes sort_scan
	extend mysqlselects /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache select_full_join select_full_range_join select_range select_range_check select_scan

5) Download and Import templates "cacti_host_template_mysql.xml" on Cacti monitoring host.

   You have to import templates using Cacti web interface. In the Cacti web interface’s Console tab, click on the "Import Templates" 
   link in the left sidebar. Browse to the directory containing the unpacked templates, select the XML file for the 
   templates (cacti_host_template_mysql.xml)you’re  installing, and submit the form.

   	Console->Import/Export->Import Templates

   Or simply import templates from the command line:

	wget https://raw.github.com/spions/cacti-mysql/master/cacti_host_template_mysql.xml

	[cacti-test-host]# php /dir_to_cacti/cacti/cli/import_template.php --filename=/dir_to_template/cacti_host_template_mysql.xml --with-user-rras='1:2:3:4'

		using RRA Weekly (30 Minute Average)
		using RRA Monthly (2 Hour Average)
		using RRA Yearly (1 Day Average)
		Read 234723 bytes of XML data
		** GPRINT Preset
		...

6) Creating Graphs.
   In Cacti’s Console tab, browse to the "Devices" link in the sidebar and click on the device you’d like to graph.

   The third item from the top of the screen should say Host Template. Change this to the name of the template you 
   imported, such as "mysql". Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Save button.

   After the page loads, click on the "Create Graphs for this Host" link at the top of the page.

Sample Graphs and Description
=============================

  Graphics are made by analogy with the project "Percona MySQL Monitoring Template for Cacti"
  http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-plugins/cacti/mysql-templates.html

  The following sample graphs demonstrate how the data is presented.

  MySQL Command Counters.
  The MySQL Command Counters graph shows counters for various MySQL commands. These are derived from the Com_ counters from SHOW STATUS. 
  If there is a change in the graph, it indicates that something changed in the application.

CONTRIBUTING
============

  This is an open-source project, and everyone is welcome to participate.  Just join the mailing list and introduce yourself.  
  Commit access to SVN, editing permission on the wiki, and anything else you need will be happily and speedily granted if you ask.
