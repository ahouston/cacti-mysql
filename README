1) Log into MySQL and execute the following (changing "secret" as appropriate) to give the script permission to monitor:

mysql -uroot -p
CREATE USER 'monitor'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'monitor'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

2) In order to read all these variables from MySQL we need credentials. 
These are stored in /etc/snmpd/mysql-stats.conf 
by default and you can modify the script if you need to change that. 

3) This one is simply an extension script for snmpd that grabs (and caches) the data when called. 
Assuming you put this extension script in /etc/snmp and have a cache directory for my extensions 
of /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/ (as described in previous articles), you can add the following to your 
/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file and then restart snmpd:

extend mysqlqcache /etc/snmp/mysql-stats /etc/snmp/mysql_cache/cache _qcache_miss_ratio _qcache_hit_ratio qcache_hits qcache_inserts qcache_total_blocks qcache_free_blocks _qcache_used_blocks query_cache_size qcache_free_memory _qcache_used_memory qcache_queries_in_cache
